Adds a web item to a specified location in the application interface. A web item is a hyperlink
thatâ€™s inserted into some standard place in the Atlassian application interface, such as the
administration menu.

<p/>

The form that the link takes can vary depending on the location. For instance, a web item in the header bar
(with a location section of system.top.navigation.bar) adds a link to the navigation bar across the top of the
interface. On the other hand, a web item in the opsbar-operation location section in JIRA adds an item to the issue
operation buttons.

<p/>

A web item link can open a new page in the application or a dialog, depending on your configuration.

Web links are a simple and useful way to extend Atlassian applications. If you want to extend an Atlassian
application and don't know where to start, a web item may be all you need.
