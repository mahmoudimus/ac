A configure page module is a page module used to configure the addon itself.
Other than that it is the same as other pages.

If more than one configure page is specified, then exactly one of them must have the [default] field set.
A 'configure' button will link to this page from the manage plugins administration console.

If there is only one configure page specified then it will automatically be used regardless of the default field.

If no configure page modules are specified then no configure button will be included on the install page.
