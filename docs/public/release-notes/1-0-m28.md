# 1.0-m28
* HTML injection in i18n property values is no longer allowed, even when the add-on has the "generate any HTML" permission.
* Java 7 is no longer required at runtime (change in atlassian-jwt 1.0-m8).
* JSON descriptors that request web-hooks must now also request the corresponding scopes required to receive these web-hooks.
    * Without the correct scope you will see an error in the host product's log during installation that tells you which scope to add.
    * For example, this error message tells you to add the "READ" scope: "Add-on 'my-add-on' requests web hook 'jira:issue_created' but not the 'READ' scope required to receive it. Please request this scope in your descriptor.".
* JIRA REST API endpoints are in the JSON descriptor scopes white-list.
    * If your add-on uses these endpoints then you can now specify scopes in your descriptor and they will be respected in authorisation checks on requests to JIRA.
    * E.g. add ```"scopes": ["READ", "WRITE"]``` to your JSON descriptor if your add-on performs read-only actions and mutating actions.
    * Scopes white-list documentation coming soon so that you will be able to figure out which scope is required for each endpoint that you access.
