# 1.1.0

Release date: XXXX

* Manage cookies through the javascript cookie api
* Manage browser history through the javascript history api
* Update dialogs to allow the chrome flag
* Dialog height is now always the height of the iframe.

### Dialog chrome flag
Both webitems and dialogs opened from javascript can now be with or without the buttons and header (chrome).
This solves the difficult task of styling a dialog opened from javascript to look like other dialogs
and enables chromeless dialogs to be opened from webitems.

#### Opening a dialog with chrome using javascript
For additional options such as header and button text, please refer to [the dialog options documentation](../javascript/DialogOptions.html)

```
AP.require(['dialog'], function(dialog){
    dialog.create({
        key: 'my-dialog-page', // the module key defined in your atlassian-connect.json descriptor file
        chrome: true        // a new config flag specifying that the header and buttons should be added
    });
})
```

#### Opening a dialog without chrome using a webitem
Adding the following to your atlassian-connect.json descriptor will create a webitem that opens a chromeless dialog. Previously, all dialogs would open with the header and buttons displayed.

```
{
    "webItems": [
        {
          "key": "my-dialog-page",
            "url": "/dialog.html",
            "location": "system.top.navigation.bar",
            "context": "addon",
            "weight": 200,
            "target": {
                "type": "dialog",
                "options": {
                    "width": "200px",
                    "height": "200px",
                    "chrome": false
                }
            },
            "name": {
                "value": "Greetings"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Updating your existing dialogs to the correct height
If you specify a height for a dialog with chrome (header and buttons), you will need to subtract 107px. Specifying a height is now deemed as the height of the iframe, not the height of the dialog. The following dialogs will need to be updated:

* Dialog page (XML Descriptor only)
* Custom Confluence macro editors
* Webitems with a target of "dialog"
