## Build add-ons to customize your Atlassian products
You can use the Atlassian Connect framework to build add-ons for Atlassian applications
 like JIRA and Confluence. An add-on could be an integration with another existing service, 
 new features for the Atlassian application, or even a new product that runs within the Atlassian application. 
 You can also create add-ons for HipChat. To learn how, <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/docs/apiv2/addons" 
 target="_blank">check out the HipChat add-on documentation</a>. 

Simply understood, Atlassian Connect add-ons are web applications.
Connect add-ons operate remotely over HTTP and can be written with any programming
language and web framework.

Fundamentally, Connect add-ons have three major capabilities:

1. Insert content in [certain defined places](./modules/jira/index.html) in the Atlassian application's UI.
2. Make calls to the Atlassian application's [REST API](./rest-apis/index.html).
3. Listen and respond to [WebHooks](./modules/jira/webhook.html) fired by the Atlassian application.
