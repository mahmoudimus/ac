# Authentication

Atlassian Connect employs usage of a technology called [JWT (JSON Web Token)](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html)
 to authenticate add-ons.

## Implementation Examples

Most modern languages have JWT libraries available. Prior to implementing JWT, consider using an existing library.

* Java (Atlassian) - [atlassian-jwt](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-jwt/)
* Java - [jsontoken](https://code.google.com/p/jsontoken/)
* Node.js - [node-jwt-simple](https://github.com/hokaccha/node-jwt-simple)
* Ruby - [ruby-jwt](https://github.com/progrium/ruby-jwt)
* PHP - [jwt](https://github.com/luciferous/jwt)
* .NET - [jwt](https://github.com/johnsheehan/jwt)

The [py-jwt-decoder](http://py-jwt-decoder.appspot.com/) is a handy web based decoder of JWT tokens.


## Handling JWT requests

Atlassian Connect add-ons specify that they are using the JWT authentication mechanism in the `authentication` module.
An add-on must accompany this with the `lifecycle` module to enable the add-on to handle the authentication process.


    {
        "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
        "key": "atlassian-connect-addon",
        "authentication": {
            "type": "jwt"
        },
        "lifecycle": {
            "installed": "/add-on-installed-callback"
        }
        modules: {} // etc
    }


The `lifecycle:installed` property is a callback url which is called when an add-on is installed into an Atlassian
application. Delivered with it is a payload with important tenant information that you will need to store in your add-on
in order to authenticate future calls. The payload contains the following attributes:

    {
        "key": "atlassian-connect-jira-addon-jwt",
        "clientKey": "1234567890",
        "publicKey": "MIGf....ZRWzwIDAQAB",
        "sharedSecret": "1ad6f705-fe0b-4111-9551-7ce5d81d2884",
        "baseUrl": "http://storm.dyn.syd.atlassian.com:2990/jira",
        "productType": "jira",
        "userKey": "admin",
        "eventType": "installed"
    }
