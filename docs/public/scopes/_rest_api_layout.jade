p
| The required scope for your add-on depends on how you interact with the resources that are exposed by the REST API.
| The table below shows the required scope for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations on a resource path. REST resources
| are versioned by a path segment that varies with the version. The supported versions are listed below the path.

h2 Example

table.aui
    thead
        tr
            th Path
            th GET
            th POST
            th PUT
            th DELETE
    tbody
        tr
            td
                code /rest/atlassian-connect/{version}/license
                p
                    span.aui-label 1
                    span.aui-label latest
            td
                +scope("READ")
            td
                +NA
            td
                +NA
            td
                +NA

p
| The example above means that a <strong>GET</strong> operation on

ul
    li
        code /rest/atlassian-connect/1/license
    li
        code /rest/atlassian-connect/latest/license

p
| will require your add-on to declare the <strong>READ</strong> scope.
| The example also shows that this specific resource only supports <strong>GET</strong>, but no other HTTP verbs.
