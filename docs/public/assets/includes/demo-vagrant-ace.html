[atlassian-connect-express](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-connect-express) is a toolkit for creating
Atlassian Connect add-ons with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). To create an add-on using the framework using the VM,
connect to the VM and run:
<div class="CodeMirror-wrap"><pre><div class="CodeMirror">cd /vagrant
atlas-connect new my-test-addon
cd my-test-addon
npm install</div></pre></div>
This creates a new project with sample add-on, and you should see all the files available in your local machine in the
folder in which you have started the VM. Then, open two command windows.
In the first one, start a local instance of JIRA:
<div class="CodeMirror-wrap"><pre><div class="CodeMirror">atlas-run-connect --product jira</div></pre></div>
In the second one, start the add-on:
<div class="CodeMirror-wrap"><pre><div class="CodeMirror">node app.js</div></pre></div>
Then open a browser in your local machine and point it to: http://localhost:2990/jira. You should see a menu item
"Hello World" in the JIRA top menu bar, which was added by the add-on.
