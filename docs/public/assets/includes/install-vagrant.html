### Background

We packaged a Vagrant box which you can use to quickly spin up a virtual machine (VM) with
the Atlassian Plugin SDK, Node.js, atlassian-connect-express, and other utilities.
It is configured to be able to access files from your machine so you can use your local IDE to write code for your
add-ons, and forward ports to your machine so you can use the browser on your machine to connect to JIRA/Confluence
on the VM.

### Installation instructions
Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

Create a directory that will host your add-on code (directory_name), then open a terminal window and run:
<div class="CodeMirror-wrap"><pre><div class="CodeMirror">cd directory_name
curl -o Vagrantfile -L http://goo.gl/76meqp
vagrant up</div></pre></div>

This will download the packaged Vagrant box (file size ~950M) and start a VM on your machine.
Note: Vagrant will then save the box so you can start other VM instances from it without having to download it again.

Then connect to the VM, review and accept the Oracle license terms (for Java)
<div class="CodeMirror-wrap"><pre><div class="CodeMirror">vagrant ssh</div></pre></div>
