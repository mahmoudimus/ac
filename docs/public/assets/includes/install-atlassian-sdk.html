### __Install the Atlassian SDK__

If you have the version 4.2.20 or higher of the Atlassian SDK installed you can skip this step.

The Atlassian Plugin SDK provides you with a toolkit of commands which are vital for developing Atlassian plugins.
To run Confluence Gardener, we'll be using a single command, [`atlas-run-standalone`](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/atlas-run-standalone), which runs a copy of an Atlassian product on your computer.

Use the following links to install the SDK

* [Instructions for Windows users](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Install+the+Atlassian+SDK+on+a+Windows+System)
* [Instructions for Mac/Linux users](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Install+the+Atlassian+SDK+on+a+Linux+or+Mac+System)

Confirm the SDK is installed by running `atlas-version`.
