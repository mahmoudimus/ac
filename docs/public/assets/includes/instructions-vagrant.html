### Working with the Vagrant VM

#### Configuration file
In the directory in which you started a VM instance of the Vagrant box, there is a file called Vagrantfile.
This file defines the configuration of the VM, and you can tweak it to match your needs.
By default, we have done the following:
* Forwarded ports to your local machine:
    * 2990: default port for JIRA
    * 1990: default port for Confluence
    * 3000: default port for the atlassian-connect-express framework
    * 8000: default port for the embedded http-server
* Defined default resource allocation, so the VM can use up to half of the memory available in your machine, and all CPUs.
* Configured file synchronisation between the VM and the local machine to use NFS (which is faster than the default)
* Configured the VM for faster internet connectivity than the default

If you change these settings, you need to reload the VM:
<pre><code data-lang="text">vagrant reload</code></pre>

#### Useful commands
You don't need to keep the VM running at all times, as this consumes system resources.

To start the VM:
<pre><code data-lang="text">vagrant up</code></pre>

To connect to the VM:
<pre><code data-lang="text">vagrant ssh</code></pre>

To halt the VM:
<pre><code data-lang="text">vagrant halt</code></pre>

To destroy the VM:
<pre><code data-lang="text">vagrant destroy</code></pre>

And to recreate it from its base configuration:
<pre><code data-lang="text">vagrant destroy
vagrant up</code></pre>

#### Sharing files with the VM
The VM is configured to share files with your local machine. By default, all files in the directory in which you
started the VM are available, from within the VM, in the directory /vagrant.

All files you create should go in this directory, not in the VM. Otherwise you will lose any change you have made if
you upgrade the VM, or recreate it.
