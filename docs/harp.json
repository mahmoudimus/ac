The Atlassian application uses this event to supply\nits public key to the add-on. The Authenticating with OAuth page shows an example of how to use this webhook.</p>\n\n<h3>Handling the webhook event</h3>\n\n<p>To receive webhook events, your add-on needs to include the webhook module declaration in its JSON descriptor. The\ndeclaration indicates the relative URL of the local resource at which it will receive the notification. In other\nwords, the Atlassian application will send an HTTP POST to this resource in response to an application event. The\nadd-on code that handles the POST should process any information passed in the body of the message, as appropriate.\nEach webhook POST sent to the add-on will also include the authentication headers that allow the add-on to\nvalidate the authenticity of that request.</p>\n\n<h4>Sample webhooks JSON block</h4>\n\n<p>{\n     \"webhooks\": [\n         {\n             \"event\": \"jira:issue<em>created\",\n             \"url\": \"/issue-created\"\n         },\n         ...\n         {\n             \"event\": \"jira:issue</em>updated\",\n             \"url\": \"/issue-updated\"\n         }\n     ]\n }</p>\n\n<h3>Webhook event types</h3>\n\n<p>To find out what webhooks are available for each application, the best place to look is in the Interactive\nDescriptor Guide <a href=\"https://developer.atlassian.com/connect/api/jira\">JIRA</a> or\n<a href=\"https://developer.atlassian.com/connect/api/confluence\">Confluence</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Inspecting webhook contents</h3>\n\n<p>Each type of webhook event includes information specific to that event in the body content of the POST message. The\nadd-on resource that listens for webhook posts should receive and process the content as appropriate for the add-on.\nTo understand what type of content each webhook generates, you can use the webhook inspector tool.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/webhook-inspector\">Webhook Inspector</a> is a\n<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-connect-express\">atlassian-connect-express</a> Connect add-on\nthat you can install in your development environment to inspect the content of event messages.

As an example:\nYou may want to react to a state transition only if the issue has a particular label, and you want the project\nadministrator to configure that label. For this purpose, three additional (optional) URLs in the descriptor\nallow you to declare the pages that will show:</p></li>\n<li><p>The read-only view or summary of the configuration</p></li>\n<li>The form that is shown when a workflow post function is first created</li>\n<li><p>The form that is shown when a workflow post function is edited</p>\n\n<p>All URLs are relative to the base URL that is declared in the connect-container element of the descriptor.</p>\n\n<p>Example workflow post function descriptor block</p>\n\n<p>\"jiraWorkflowPostFunctions\": [\n    {\n     \"name\": {\n         \"i18n\": \"my.function\",\n         \"value\": \"My  function\"\n     },\n     \"description\": {\n         \"i18n\": \"my.function.desc\",\n         \"value\": \"My function description\"\n     },\n     \"triggered\": {\n         \"url\": \"/triggered\"\n     },\n     \"create\": {\n         \"url\": \"/create\"\n     },\n     \"edit\": {\n         \"url\": \"/edit\"\n     },\n     \"view\": {\n         \"url\": \"/view\"\n     }\n }]</p>\n\n<h2>Contents of the HTTP POST</h2>\n\n<p>To understand the type of content that is sent to the add-on after a state transition, you can use the webhook\ninspector tool.

Atlassian OnDemand applications can execute\n webhooks that your add-ons can use to be notified of certain events that happen in JIRA or Confluence.</p>\n\n<p>Just to give you an idea of how you can use them in add-ons, here are a few sample webhook events:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When an add-on is enabled or disabled</li>\n<li>When an issue is created or closed in JIRA</li>\n<li><p>When a page is created or updated in Confluence</p>\n\n<p>While some webhooks are specific to the Atlassian application, JIRA or Confluence, others are common to all\napplications. This type includes, for example, the webhooks that generate notifications when the add-on is enabled.</p>\n\n<p>Most add-ons should implement the remote<em>plugin</em>enabled webhook. The Atlassian application uses this event to supply\nits public key to the add-on. The Authenticating with OAuth page shows an example of how to use this webhook.</p>\n\n<h3>Handling the webhook event</h3>\n\n<p>To receive webhook events, your add-on needs to include the webhook module declaration in its JSON descriptor. The\ndeclaration indicates the relative URL of the local resource at which it will receive the notification. In other\nwords, the Atlassian application will send an HTTP POST to this resource in response to an application event. The\nadd-on code that handles the POST should process any information passed in the body of the message, as appropriate.\nEach webhook POST sent to the add-on will also include the authentication headers that allow the add-on to\nvalidate the authenticity of that request.</p>\n\n<h4>Sample webhooks JSON block</h4>\n\n<p>{\n     \"webhooks\": [\n         {\n             \"event\": \"jira:issue<em>created\",\n             \"url\": \"/issue-created\"\n         },\n         ...\n         {\n             \"event\": \"jira:issue</em>updated\",\n             \"url\": \"/issue-updated\"\n         }\n     ]\n }</p>\n\n<h3>Webhook event types</h3>\n\n<p>To find out what webhooks are available for each application, the best place to look is in the Interactive\nDescriptor Guide <a href=\"https://developer.atlassian.com/connect/api/jira\">JIRA</a> or\n<a href=\"https://developer.atlassian.com/connect/api/confluence\">Confluence</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Inspecting webhook contents</h3>\n\n<p>Each type of webhook event includes information specific to that event in the body content of the POST message. The\nadd-on resource that listens for webhook posts should receive and process the content as appropriate for the add-on.\nTo understand what type of content each webhook generates, you can use the webhook inspector tool.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/webhook-inspector\">Webhook Inspector</a> is a\n<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-connect-express\">atlassian-connect-express</a> Connect add-on\nthat you can install in your development environment to inspect the content of event messages. The Webhook Inspector\nsubscribes and generates each webhook event type available on the running instance of the Atlassian application,\nand prints the body posted by the instance to the console screen.</p></li>\n</ul>",

It\n will also include the authentication headers that allow the add-on to validate the authenticity of that request.\n\n Often, the workflow post function will allow some degree of configuration of its behavior. As an example:\n You may want to react to a state transition only if the issue has a particular label, and you want the project\n administrator to configure that label. For this purpose, three additional (optional) URLs in the descriptor\n allow you to declare the pages that will show:\n\n * The read-only view or summary of the configuration\n * The form that is shown when a workflow post function is first created\n * The form that is shown when a workflow post function is edited\n\n All URLs are relative to the base URL that is declared in the connect-container element of the descriptor.\n\n Example workflow post function descriptor block\n\n     \"jiraWorkflowPostFunctions\": [\n \t   {\n         \"name\": {\n             \"i18n\": \"my.function\",\n             \"value\": \"My  function\"\n         },\n         \"description\": {\n             \"i18n\": \"my.function.desc\",\n             \"value\": \"My function description\"\n         },\n         \"triggered\": {\n             \"url\": \"/triggered\"\n         },\n         \"create\": {\n             \"url\": \"/create\"\n         },\n         \"edit\": {\n             \"url\": \"/edit\"\n         },\n         \"view\": {\n             \"url\": \"/view\"\n         }\n     }]\n\n ## Contents of the HTTP POST\n\n To understand the type of content that is sent to the add-on after a state transition, you can use the webhook\n inspector tool. The [Webhook Inspector](https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/webhook-inspector) is a Connect add-on\n that you can install in your development environment to inspect the content of event messages.\n\n Here is an example POST body:\n\n      {\n          \"configuration\": {\n              \"value\": \"Configuration from the post function edit page\"\n          },\n          \"issue\": {\n              \"fields\": {\n                  \"assignee\": {\n                      \"active\": true,\n                      \"avatarUrls\": {\n                          \"16x16\": \"http://issues.example.com/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10062\",\n                          \"24x24\": \"http://issues.example.com/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10062\",\n                          \"32x32\": \"http://issues.example.com/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10062\",\n                          \"48x48\": \"http://issues.example.com/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10062\"\n                      },\n                      \"displayName\": \"A.

This type includes, for example, the webhooks that generate notifications when the add-on is enabled.\n\n Most add-ons should implement the remote_plugin_enabled webhook. The Atlassian application uses this event to supply\n its public key to the add-on. The Authenticating with OAuth page shows an example of how to use this webhook.\n\n ### Handling the webhook event\n\n To receive webhook events, your add-on needs to include the webhook module declaration in its JSON descriptor. The\n declaration indicates the relative URL of the local resource at which it will receive the notification. In other\n words, the Atlassian application will send an HTTP POST to this resource in response to an application event. The\n add-on code that handles the POST should process any information passed in the body of the message, as appropriate.\n Each webhook POST sent to the add-on will also include the authentication headers that allow the add-on to\n validate the authenticity of that request.\n\n #### Sample webhooks JSON block\n\n     {\n         \"webhooks\": [\n             {\n                 \"event\": \"jira:issue_created\",\n                 \"url\": \"/issue-created\"\n             },\n             ...\n             {\n                 \"event\": \"jira:issue_updated\",\n                 \"url\": \"/issue-updated\"\n             }\n         ]\n     }\n\n ### Webhook event types\n\n To find out what webhooks are available for each application, the best place to look is in the Interactive\n Descriptor Guide [JIRA](https://developer.atlassian.com/connect/api/jira) or\n [Confluence](https://developer.atlassian.com/connect/api/confluence).\n\n ### Inspecting webhook contents\n\n Each type of webhook event includes information specific to that event in the body content of the POST message. The\n add-on resource that listens for webhook posts should receive and process the content as appropriate for the add-on.\n To understand what type of content each webhook generates, you can use the webhook inspector tool.\n\n The <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/webhook-inspector\">Webhook Inspector</a> is a\n <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-connect-express\">atlassian-connect-express</a> Connect add-on\n that you can install in your development environment to inspect the content of event messages. The Webhook Inspector\n subscribes and generates each webhook event type available on the running instance of the Atlassian application,\n and prints the body posted by the instance to the console screen.\n"

                  "description": "A webhook is a standard mechanism for implementing HTTP callbacks. Atlassian OnDemand applications can execute\n webhooks that your add-ons can use to be notified of certain events that happen in JIRA or Confluence.\n\n Just to give you an idea of how you can use them in add-ons, here are a few sample webhook events:\n\n * When an add-on is enabled or disabled\n * When an issue is created or closed in JIRA\n * When a page is created or updated in Confluence\n\n While some webhooks are specific to the Atlassian application, JIRA or Confluence, others are common to all\n applications. This type includes, for example, the webhooks that generate notifications when the add-on is enabled.\n\n Most add-ons should implement the remote_plugin_enabled webhook. The Atlassian application uses this event to supply\n its public key to the add-on. The Authenticating with OAuth page shows an example of how to use this webhook.\n\n ### Handling the webhook event\n\n To receive webhook events, your add-on needs to include the webhook module declaration in its JSON descriptor. The\n declaration indicates the relative URL of the local resource at which it will receive the notification. In other\n words, the Atlassian application will send an HTTP POST to this resource in response to an application event. The\n add-on code that handles the POST should process any information passed in the body of the message, as appropriate.\n Each webhook POST sent to the add-on will also include the authentication headers that allow the add-on to\n validate the authenticity of that request.\n\n #### Sample webhooks JSON block\n\n     {\n         \"webhooks\": [\n             {\n                 \"event\": \"jira:issue_created\",\n                 \"url\": \"/issue-created\"\n             },\n             ...\n             {\n                 \"event\": \"jira:issue_updated\",\n                 \"url\": \"/issue-updated\"\n             }\n         ]\n     }\n\n ### Webhook event types\n\n To find out what webhooks are available for each application, the best place to look is in the Interactive\n Descriptor Guide [JIRA](https://developer.atlassian.com/connect/api/jira) or\n [Confluence](https://developer.atlassian.com/connect/api/confluence).\n\n ### Inspecting webhook contents\n\n Each type of webhook event includes information specific to that event in the body content of the POST message. The\n add-on resource that listens for webhook posts should receive and process the content as appropriate for the add-on.\n To understand what type of content each webhook generates, you can use the webhook inspector tool.\n\n The <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/webhook-inspector\">Webhook Inspector</a> is a\n <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-connect-express\">atlassian-connect-express</a> Connect add-on\n that you can install in your development environment to inspect the content of event messages. The Webhook Inspector\n subscribes and generates each webhook event type available on the running instance of the Atlassian application,\n and prints the body posted by the instance to the console screen.\n"
