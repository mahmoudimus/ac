/**
 * Page modules are UI extension points that add-ons can use to insert content into various areas of the host
 * application's interface. You implement a page module (along with the other type of module you can use with
 * Atlassian Connect, webhooks) by declaring it in the add-on descriptor and implementing the add-on code that
 * composes it.
 *
 * Each application has page module types that are specific for it, but there are some common page types as well.
 * For instance, both JIRA and Confluence support the general-page and profile-page module, but only JIRA has the
 * issue-panel-page.
 *
 * The page module takes care of integrating the add-on content into the application for you. The add-on content
 * automatically gets the page styles and decorators from the host application.
 *
 *
 *
 * Adds a web item to a specified location in the application interface. A web item is a hyperlink
 * thatâ€™s inserted into some standard place in the Atlassian application interface, such as the
 * administration menu.
 *
 * <p/>
 *
 * The form that the link takes can vary depending on the location. For instance, a web item in the header bar
 * (with a location section of system.top.navigation.bar) adds a link to the navigation bar across the top of the
 * interface. On the other hand, a web item in the opsbar-operation location section in JIRA adds an item to the issue
 * operation buttons.
 *
 * <p/>
 *
 * A web item link can open a new page in the application or a dialog, depending on your configuration.
 *
 * <p/>
 *
 * Web links are a simple and useful way to extend Atlassian applications. If you want to extend an Atlassian
 * application and don't know where to start, a web item may be all you need.
