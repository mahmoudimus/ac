# Atlassian Connect

[Atlassian Connect](https://connect.atlassian.com) is a platform for developers to build add-ons to integrate with
Atlassianâ€™s cloud offerings. An add-on could be an integration with another existing service, new features for the
Atlassian application, or even a new product that runs within the Atlassian application.

This repository contains `atlassian-connect-plugin`, the implementation of Atlassian Connect for a subset of the
products based on [`atlassian-plugins`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-plugins): JIRA and Confluence.

## Dependencies

* JDK 8
* Maven 3.2

## Usage

To build and run an Atlassian product with the development version of Atlassian Connect:

    mvn clean install
    mvn -pl plugin amps:debug -Dproduct=<jira|confluence>

To run an Atlassian product with a recent release of Atlassian Connect, see
[Release notes](https://developer.atlassian.com/static/connect/docs/latest/resources/release-notes.html) in the
developer documentation.

To run with Universal Plugin Manager able to connect to Atlassian Marketplace, append the following parameter to the command.

    -Djvmargs='-Datlassian.upm.on.demand=true'

### Repository structure

* `api-parent` - the parent of all modules containing public interfaces
	* `api` - a draft application programming interface for the plugin
	* `spi` - a draft service provider interface for the plugin
* `bin` - utility scripts
* `confluence` - the parent of all Confluence-specific modules
	* `confluence-support` - support for Atlassian Connect in Confluence
	* `confluence-reference-plugin` - a reference implementation of some SPI interfaces for Confluence
* `crowd-support` - support for Atlassian Connect in products that use Atlassian Crowd
* `docs` - a Node.js project for generating [the developer documentation](https://connect.atlassian.com)
* `jira` - the parent of all JIRA-specific modules
	* `jira-reference-plugin` - a reference implementation of some SPI interfaces for JIRA
	* `jira-integration-tests` - JIRA-specific integration tests for the plugin
* `jsapi` - builds the JavaScript API based on [`atlassian-connect-js`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-connect-js)
* `modules` - bean representations of add-on JSON descriptor elements
* `plugin` - groups the other modules into a plugin
* `tests` - the parent of all non-product-specific test modules
    * `descriptor-validation-tests` - JSON schema validation of all public add-ons for JIRA and Confluence on Atlassian Marketplace
    * `integration-tests` - integration tests for the plugin
    * `plugin-lifecycle-tests` - wired tests for the plugin lifecycle, requiring plugin uninstallation
    * `test-support-plugin` - a collection of test utility classes
    * `wired-tests` - wired tests for the plugin

### Branches

This repository uses the [git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-gitflow) branching workflow.

* `master` - contains the latest release
* `develop` - contains the stable development version

### Building

To build the plugin:

    mvn clean install

To speed up subsequent builds, the `-` prefix can be used with the `-pl` option to exclude specific modules,
e.g. the `jsapi` module which invokes a time-consuming Node.js build.

    mvn clean install -pl -jsapi

### Running tests

To run unit tests:

    mvn test

To run JavaScript unit tests:

    mvn clean package -Pkarma-tests -DskipUnits

To run wired tests:

    mvn clean install
    mvn -pl tests/wired-tests verify -am -Pwired

To run plug-in lifecycle tests:

    mvn -pl tests/plugin-lifecycle-tests verify -am -PpluginLifecycle

To run integration tests:

    mvn -pl tests/integration-tests verify -Pit -am [-DtestGroups=...]

To run add-on descriptor validation tests:

    mvn -pl tests/descriptor-validation-tests verify -PdescriptorValidation -DskipTests -am

### Updating developer documentation

To generate [the developer documentation](https://connect.atlassian.com):

    mvn clean install site
